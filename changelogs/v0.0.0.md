Initial release of the project. This version introduces the foundational `DataFrame` type definition and its helper functions. No models or training functionality are included yet.

<!-- truncate -->

## Added
- `DataFrame` type definition with helper functions for initialization and modification.
    - Uses a **1D array** under the hood instead of a traditional 2D array.
    - Utilizes **arithmetic indexing** $row_i \cdot cols + col_i$ to avoid multi-indexing overhead.
