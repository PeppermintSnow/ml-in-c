        Clone and build the files using CMake.
        ```bash
        git clone -b main git@github.com:PeppermintSnow/ml-in-c.git --single-branch && cd ml-in-c
        mkdir build && cd build
        cmake ..
        make
        ```
        :::tip[Global Install]
        It is also recommended to install globally for ease of use.

        :::info[Compiling]
        Now you can compile your programs with the library.
        ```bash
        gcc myProgram.c -I/usr/local/include/ml-in-c -L/usr/local/lib -lml-in-c -o myProgram
        ```
        :::
        :::danger[Uninstall]
        You can also remove the library by running the uninstall command.
